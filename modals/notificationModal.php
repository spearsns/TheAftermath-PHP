          <ul>
            <li>
              First and foremost it is highly recommended that new players take a look at both the "Apocalypse" and "User Manual" first in order to get a feel for what they are stepping into!
            </li>
            <li>
              When you are ready to begin, click the "Join Us" link at the top of the page OR feel free to explore by logging in as a Guest by entering Username = "Guest" Password = "guest" (case sensitive)
            </li>
            <li>
              Forfeit your data in order to create a user for the site (Keep your login password less than 30 characters for now)
            </li>
            <li>
              Log in by clicking the "Login" button at the top of the page and enter the information provided in the previous step
            </li>
            <li>
              Notice that the Username field is populated by your given information. Click the "New Character" to begin if you intend to start your journey as a player. Otherwise you can click "New Game" and make your debut as a Storyteller by entering the required information
            </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As a storyteller, all you need to do is pass along the Player Password you created to anyone that you would like to join your game, click the associated "Tell" button, log in with the Storyteller Password you made for yourself and hang tight till your players show up! 
                </li>
                <li>
                  For the players just know that your new character's dice rolls are automatically generated for their traits.  2 is the Minimum value, 20 is the Maximum value.  If you are unhappy with your results simply refresh the page or click the "Re-Roll" button in order to generate a new character
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make note of the Background field.  This explains how this particular character has been spending their time once the bombs fell and will determine the skills that they have picked up along the way
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pay attention to the "Point Pool" field.  This is the additional points that you may spend in order to increase your initial traits (Don't worry, you can improve them as you earn experience or spend time training)
                </li>
                <li>
                  You must spend all points within the pool and choose your sex before continuing to the Character Development page
                </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      High (or well rounded) Traits are more important than Background!  Your character is just beginning their journey, what they did before their premier is of little consequence aside from what they have already learned from their time on Earth!
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>
                  Once on the Character Development page make note of the "Skill Choices" tab at the top before choosing your additional skills
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Yellow buttons are ONE skill choice, whereas Red buttons are highly specialized and cost TWO
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a skill already has a value, when it's chosen it will be improved by 2D10.  You can do this as many times you like.  If it doesn't have a value you can select it once and your traits will determine the initial value and then the button will become disabled
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <br>
